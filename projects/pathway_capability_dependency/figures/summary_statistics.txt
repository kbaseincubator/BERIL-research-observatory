=== Metabolic Capability vs Dependency: Summary Statistics ===
Analysis date: 2026-02-19

--- Tier 1: Fitness-Validated Classification (NB02) ---
FB organisms analyzed: 7
GapMind pathways analyzed: 23
Total classifications: 161
Mapping approach: FB-native KEGG (besthitkegg → keggmember → EC → KEGG map)
  Active Dependency: 57 (35.4%)
  Latent Capability: 66 (41.0%)
  Incomplete but Important: 24 (14.9%)
  Missing: 14 (8.7%)

Key finding: 35.4% Active Dependencies — pathways complete AND fitness-important
Key finding: Condition-type analysis reveals ALL Latent Capabilities become
  important under specific conditions (N, stress, C limitation)
  → supports core_gene_tradeoffs: "costly in lab but conserved in nature"

--- Tier 2: Pan-Bacterial Pathway Conservation (NB03) ---
Species analyzed: 2,810
H1b: Variable pathways vs openness: rho=0.327, p=7.2e-71
Partial Spearman (ctrl n_genomes): rho=0.530, p=2.83e-203
Key finding: Species with more variable pathways have more open pangenomes
Key finding: Amino acid biosynthesis shows largest accessory dependence gap

Top accessory-dependent pathways:
  leu: gap=0.146 (all=0.614, core=0.468)
  val: gap=0.146 (all=0.614, core=0.468)
  arg: gap=0.141 (all=0.613, core=0.472)
  lys: gap=0.140 (all=0.804, core=0.664)
  thr: gap=0.140 (all=0.803, core=0.663)

--- Metabolic Ecotypes (NB04) ---
Species with ecotypes: 225
Median ecotypes per species: 4
Max ecotypes: 8
Ecotypes vs openness: rho=0.262, p=6.8e-05
Key finding: More metabolic ecotypes → more open pangenomes

--- Cross-Project Context ---
  metal_fitness_atlas: 87.4% metal-fitness genes are core (OR=2.08)
  conservation_fitness_synthesis: 16pp fitness-conservation gradient
  ecotype_analysis: phylogeny dominates gene content (60.5% of species)
  pangenome_openness: null result for openness vs env/phylo
  core_gene_tradeoffs: 28,017 genes costly in lab but conserved in nature

# Contamination Gradient vs Functional Potential in ENIGMA Communities

## Research Question

Do high-contamination Oak Ridge groundwater communities show enrichment for taxa with higher inferred stress-related functional potential compared with low-contamination communities?

## Status

Completed -- initial ENIGMA contamination-functional synthesis executed (n=108 samples). No significant association detected between contamination index and inferred stress functional potential in the first-pass genus-level model; see REPORT.md for details.

## Overview

This project uses ENIGMA CORAL field data to test whether contamination gradients (uranium and co-occurring metals) are associated with shifts in inferred community functional potential. Functional potential will be estimated by linking ENIGMA taxa to BERDL pangenome annotations and aggregating stress-relevant functional signals (for example COG defense/mobilome and related annotation categories) at the site level. The analysis targets community-level ecological filtering rather than gene-level causality.

## Reproduction

Prerequisites and runnable notebook instructions will be finalized after the extraction pipeline is validated on BERDL JupyterHub.

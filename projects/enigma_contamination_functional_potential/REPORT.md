# Report: Contamination Gradient vs Functional Potential in ENIGMA Communities

## Key Findings

### H1 not supported in current genus-level model
Across 108 overlapping ENIGMA samples, contamination index was not significantly associated with inferred stress-related functional potential in either mapping mode.

![Stress score vs contamination index by mapping mode](figures/contamination_vs_functional_score.png)

- `site_defense_score`: rho = 0.0682, Spearman p = 0.483, permutation p = 0.463, OLS beta = 0.000888, OLS p = 0.127, adjusted OLS p = 0.0842
- `site_stress_score`: rho = 0.0139, Spearman p = 0.886, permutation p = 0.870, OLS beta = 0.000690, OLS p = 0.673, adjusted OLS p = 0.550
- `site_metabolism_score`: rho = -0.0147, Spearman p = 0.880, permutation p = 0.868, OLS beta = 0.000466, OLS p = 0.950, adjusted OLS p = 0.721
- `site_mobilome_score`: rho = -0.00746, Spearman p = 0.939, permutation p = 0.938, OLS beta = 0.000492, OLS p = 0.857, adjusted OLS p = 0.727
- These estimates are currently identical for `strict_single_clade` and `relaxed_all_clades` in the rerun outputs.

### Mapping sensitivity unresolved in this rerun
The bridge generation still reports distinct strict vs relaxed clade inventories (`strict`: 530 clades, `relaxed`: 7,380 clades), but NB02 currently copies strict-mode feature values into relaxed mode for runtime stability. As a result, downstream site scores and model statistics are numerically identical across mapping modes in this rerun.

Coverage diagnostics from upstream outputs:
- 1,392 ENIGMA genera observed
- 530 mapped genera, 862 unmapped genera
- Bridge table rows: 8,242 (many-to-many genus-to-clade expansion)
- Functional feature rows: 3,180 (530 genera x 3 features x 2 modes)
- Mean mapped abundance fraction: 0.343 (range 0.031 to 0.854), identical across both mapping modes

### Contamination index was broad but right-skewed
NB03 built contamination index from 8 metal columns (`arsenic`, `cadmium`, `chromium`, `copper`, `lead`, `nickel`, `uranium`, `zinc`) using per-metal `log1p` z-scoring and row-wise mean.

- n = 108 samples
- min = -0.448, max = 3.836
- median = -0.271, IQR = [-0.363, 0.053]

## Results

NB01 extracted and QC-filtered overlap data to 108 samples with both geochemistry and community composition:
- Geochemistry matrix shape: `(108, 49)`
- Community taxon rows: `41,711`
- Distinct communities: `212`
- Distinct genera: `1,392`

NB02 built a genus-normalized bridge to pangenome clades:
- GTDB species rows parsed for genus mapping: `27,690`
- Mapped genera: `530`
- Unmapped genera: `862`
- Strict clades: `530`, relaxed clades: `7,380`
- Current notebook implementation note: relaxed-mode functional features are copied from strict mode in this rerun, so mode-level feature and model outputs are identical.

NB03 produced:
- Site functional score rows: `216` (108 samples x 2 mapping modes)
- Model result rows: `8` (4 outcomes x 2 mapping modes)

Overall, the modeled contamination-functional signal is weak and statistically unsupported under this feature abstraction, so H1 is not supported and H0 is not rejected.

## Interpretation

Within this ENIGMA subset, contamination gradients did not translate into a robust community-level shift in inferred stress-related functional potential when features are aggregated at genus resolution from broad COG categories. This is compatible with contamination-driven taxonomic turnover that is functionally redundant or too fine-scale (species/strain/pathway level) for the present mapping.

### Literature Context
- Directionally aligned with prior BERIL ENIGMA work in `projects/lab_field_ecology/REPORT.md`, where contamination effects are evident ecologically but are not guaranteed to collapse into one global functional index.
- The bridge and annotation strategy relies on GTDB taxonomy and eggNOG functional annotation conventions; broad annotation classes can dilute specific metal-stress pathway signal.

### Novel Contribution
This project contributes a reproducible ENIGMA-to-BERDL functional inference workflow and a transparent null-result benchmark across four functional outcomes, with full export of bridge, feature, score, and model tables.

### Limitations
- Genus-level mapping may mask strain-level adaptation.
- 862/1,392 observed genera were unmapped to current pangenome bridge.
- COG-fraction proxies are coarse summaries, not curated resistance pathways.
- Current models are primarily unadjusted for depth/site/time structure beyond sample overlap filtering.
- Strict-vs-relaxed mapping sensitivity is not fully evaluated in this rerun because relaxed-mode feature values were copied from strict mode in NB02.

## Future Directions

1. Replace COG-fraction proxies with curated metal-stress gene sets and pathway-level summaries.
2. Increase taxonomic resolution where possible (species/strain-level bridge) and quantify incremental gains over genus-level mapping.
3. Fit adjusted models with explicit covariates (depth, location cluster, sampling date) and compositional modeling controls.
4. Investigate unmapped genera contribution to contamination gradients and bridge expansion opportunities.
5. Re-enable independent relaxed-mode feature construction to complete the planned mapping sensitivity analysis.

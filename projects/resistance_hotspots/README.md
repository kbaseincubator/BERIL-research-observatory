# Antibiotic Resistance Hotspots in Microbial Pangenomes

## Research Question

Which microbial species and ecological environments show the highest concentration of antibiotic resistance genes, and can we predict resistance accumulation from phylogenetic and ecological features?

## Status

Proposed — Analysis pipeline designed across 6 phases; execution pending.

## Overview

This project maps antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across 293,059 genomes in the BERDL pangenome collection, identifies species and environmental hotspots, analyzes whether ARGs are preferentially core or accessory genes, and evaluates fitness trade-offs using the Fitness Browser transposon mutant data. It integrates annotations from eggNOG, CARD, and ResFinder with pangenome structure and ecological metadata.

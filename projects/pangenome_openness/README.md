# Pangenome Openness Analysis

## Research Question

Do open pangenomes show different patterns of environmental vs phylogenetic effects compared to closed pangenomes?

## Status

Completed — No significant correlation found between pangenome openness and environment/phylogeny effect sizes.

## Overview

This project tests whether pangenome openness (the ratio of variable to total genes) predicts whether environmental similarity or phylogenetic relatedness drives gene content variation. It builds on the ecotype_analysis project's partial correlation results, correlating them with pre-computed pangenome statistics from the BERDL `pangenome` table. The null result suggests pangenome structure is independent of eco-phylo dynamics.

# Pangenome Openness, Metabolic Pathways, and Phylogenetic Distances

## Research Question

How do pangenome characteristics (open vs. closed) correlate with metabolic pathway completeness, phylogenetic distances, and species ecology?

## Status

Proposed — Analysis pipeline designed; execution pending.

## Overview

This project investigates whether pangenome openness correlates with GapMind metabolic pathway completeness and phylogenetic/structural distances from AlphaEarth embeddings. It tests whether open pangenomes indicate generalist species with broader niche adaptation and greater metabolic pathway diversity, while closed pangenomes indicate specialists with conserved core pathways. The analysis controls for phylogenetic signal using independent contrasts or PGLS.

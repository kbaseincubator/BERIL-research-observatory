# Ecotype Correlation Analysis

## Research Question

What drives gene content similarity between bacterial genomes: environmental similarity or phylogenetic relatedness?

## Status

Completed — Phylogeny dominates gene content similarity in 60.5% of 172 species analyzed; environment effects are weak and not significant for most species.

## Overview

This project tests whether environmental similarity predicts gene content similarity between bacterial genomes after controlling for phylogenetic distance. Using AlphaEarth environmental embeddings, pairwise ANI, and gene cluster profiles across 172 species, it computes partial correlations to disentangle the relative contributions of ecology and evolutionary history to pangenome composition.

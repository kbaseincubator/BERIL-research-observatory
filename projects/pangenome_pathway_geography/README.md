# Pangenome Openness, Metabolic Pathways, and Biogeography

## Research Question

Do pangenome characteristics (open vs. closed) correlate with metabolic pathway diversity and biogeographic distribution patterns?

## Status

In Progress — Data extraction and analysis pipeline designed; execution pending.

## Overview

This project investigates the relationships between pangenome openness, GapMind metabolic pathway completeness, and biogeographic distribution (via AlphaEarth embeddings) across 27,690 bacterial species. It tests whether open pangenomes have more variable pathway completeness, whether broader ecological niches correlate with higher pathway diversity, and whether open pangenomes exhibit broader niche breadth.

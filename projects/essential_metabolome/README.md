# The Pan-Bacterial Essential Metabolome

## Research Question

Which biochemical reactions are universally essential across bacteria, and what does the essential metabolome reveal about the minimal core metabolism required for microbial life?

## Status

Complete — pilot study analyzing 7 organisms with GapMind pathway data. See [Report](REPORT.md) for findings on amino acid biosynthesis conservation and *Desulfovibrio vulgaris* serine auxotrophy.

## Overview

This pilot study analyzes metabolic pathway completeness across 7 bacterial organisms with essential gene data using GapMind predictions from `kbase_ke_pangenome`. The analysis reveals **high conservation of amino acid biosynthesis pathways** (17/18 pathways present in all organisms) with one notable exception: *Desulfovibrio vulgaris* lacks serine biosynthesis, representing a potential metabolic auxotrophy.

**Key finding**: Near-universal amino acid prototrophy among free-living bacteria, with organism-specific gaps reflecting ecological adaptation.

**Limitation**: E. coli genomes are absent from the pangenome GapMind dataset (too many genomes for species-level analysis), limiting this to a 7-organism pilot study rather than the intended pan-bacterial survey.

**Original plan** (EC→reaction approach, not completed):
The original plan was to map essential genes → EC numbers → biochemical reactions using ModelSEED. This was abandoned when we discovered the biochemistry database lacks EC→reaction mappings (see RESEARCH_PLAN.md revision history for details). The project pivoted to GapMind pathway-level analysis instead.

## Workflow Testing Goals

This project serves as a validation of the new local BERDL workflow:

**MinIO Operations**:
- ✅ Download essential gene data from lakehouse: `mc cp --recursive berdl-minio/.../essential_genome/data/ ./data/`
- ⏳ Upload project results: `python tools/lakehouse_upload.py essential_metabolome`

**Spark Connect Queries**:
- ⏳ Query eggNOG annotations for essential gene clusters
- ⏳ Join EC numbers to ModelSEED reactions
- ⏳ Extract reaction properties (reversibility, pathways, cofactors)

**Local Analysis**:
- ⏳ Pathway enrichment (Fisher's exact test, FDR correction)
- ⏳ Metabolic network analysis (betweenness centrality)
- ⏳ Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

## Reproduction

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ with packages from `requirements.txt`
- `KBASE_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env` file
- Access to BERDL Spark Connect (requires active JupyterHub session or local proxy)

### Steps
1. **Setup environment**: Activate `.venv-berdl` (see `scripts/bootstrap_client.sh`)
2. **Run notebooks in order**:
   - `02_gapmind_pathway_analysis.ipynb` — Main analysis (Spark Connect, ~5 min)
   - Outputs saved to `data/` and `figures/`
3. **Optional**: `01_extract_essential_reactions.ipynb` — Shows exploratory EC-reaction work (for reference only)

### Expected Runtimes
- NB02 (GapMind analysis): ~5 minutes (mostly Spark query time)
- Total analysis time: ~10 minutes

### Note
This analysis references data from the `essential_genome` project (lakehouse: `berdl-minio/.../essential_genome/data/`). The essential gene families are not copied locally.

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for full Python dependencies. Key packages:
- `pyspark` — Spark Connect client
- `pandas` — Data manipulation
- `scipy` — Statistical tests
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — Visualization
- `networkx` or `igraph` — Metabolic network analysis

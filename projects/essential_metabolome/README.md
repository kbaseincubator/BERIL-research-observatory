# The Pan-Bacterial Essential Metabolome

## Research Question

Which biochemical reactions are universally essential across bacteria, and what does the essential metabolome reveal about the minimal core metabolism required for microbial life?

## Status

In Progress — research plan created, awaiting data extraction.

## Overview

This project links experimental gene essentiality data (from RB-TnSeq experiments across 48 bacterial organisms) to biochemical reactions in the ModelSEED database. By mapping universally essential gene families (identified in the `essential_genome` project) to their catalyzed reactions, we identify the core set of metabolic reactions required for bacterial life. This represents the first pan-bacterial experimental characterization of essential metabolism, bridging the gap between genetic essentiality and biochemical function.

**Key innovation**: Uses the new local BERDL workflow to test:
- MinIO data access (download existing essential gene data, upload results)
- Spark Connect queries from local machine (EC annotations, biochemistry reactions)
- Cross-database integration (Fitness Browser → Pangenome → Biochemistry)

## Data Sources

| Source | Purpose | Scale | Attribution |
|--------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `projects/essential_genome/` (lakehouse) | Universally essential gene families (859 families, 48 organisms) | 17K ortholog groups | Dehal (2026) |
| `kbase_ke_pangenome.eggnog_mapper_annotations` | EC numbers for gene clusters | 93M annotations | BERDL |
| `kbase_msd_biochemistry.reaction` | Biochemical reactions | 56K reactions | ModelSEED |
| `kbase_msd_biochemistry.reaction_ec` | EC → reaction mappings | Small | ModelSEED |

**Note**: Essential gene family data is referenced from the lakehouse (`berdl-minio/.../microbialdiscoveryforge/projects/essential_genome/data/`) rather than copied locally. See `projects/essential_genome/` for the original analysis.

## Workflow Testing Goals

This project serves as a validation of the new local BERDL workflow:

**MinIO Operations**:
- ✅ Download essential gene data from lakehouse: `mc cp --recursive berdl-minio/.../essential_genome/data/ ./data/`
- ⏳ Upload project results: `python tools/lakehouse_upload.py essential_metabolome`

**Spark Connect Queries**:
- ⏳ Query eggNOG annotations for essential gene clusters
- ⏳ Join EC numbers to ModelSEED reactions
- ⏳ Extract reaction properties (reversibility, pathways, cofactors)

**Local Analysis**:
- ⏳ Pathway enrichment (Fisher's exact test, FDR correction)
- ⏳ Metabolic network analysis (betweenness centrality)
- ⏳ Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

## Reproduction

*Prerequisites and step-by-step instructions will be added after analysis is complete.*

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.10+
- `.venv-berdl` environment (see `scripts/bootstrap_client.sh`)
- `KBASE_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env`
- BERDL proxy chain running (for Spark Connect queries)
- MinIO credentials (for data download/upload)

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for full Python dependencies. Key packages:
- `pyspark` — Spark Connect client
- `pandas` — Data manipulation
- `scipy` — Statistical tests
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — Visualization
- `networkx` or `igraph` — Metabolic network analysis

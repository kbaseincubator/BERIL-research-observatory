# Report: Functional Dark Matter — Experimentally Prioritized Novel Genetic Systems

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: One in four bacterial genes is functionally dark, and 17,344 have experimentally measurable phenotypes

Across 48 Fitness Browser organisms (228,709 genes), 57,011 (24.9%) lack functional annotation ("hypothetical protein," DUF, or "uncharacterized"). Of these, 7,787 show strong fitness effects (|fitness| ≥ 2 in at least one condition), and 9,557 are essential (no viable transposon mutants). Together, these 17,344 genes represent the experimentally actionable "dark matter" — genes with clear biological importance but unknown function.

![Annotation breakdown by organism](figures/fig01_annotation_breakdown.png)

Dark genes are not randomly distributed across organisms: some species have >35% hypothetical genes while others have <15%, reflecting differences in annotation depth rather than true functional content.

### Finding 2: 39,532 dark genes link to the pangenome; 6,142 belong to co-regulated fitness modules

Of 57,011 dark genes, 39,532 (69.3%) have pangenome links via the `conservation_vs_fitness` project. Among these, 12,686 are accessory (environment-specific) and 511 are both accessory and have strong fitness effects — the prime candidates for biogeographic analysis. Additionally, 6,142 dark genes belong to ICA fitness modules from the `fitness_modules` project, providing guilt-by-association function predictions.

![Condition class distribution for dark genes with strong phenotypes](figures/fig04_condition_classes.png)

Stress conditions (metals, oxidative, osmotic) dominate among dark genes with strong fitness effects, followed by carbon source utilization and nitrogen source utilization.

### Finding 3: GapMind identifies 1,256 organism-pathway pairs with metabolic gaps in species harboring dark genes

Across 44 FB-linked species, GapMind pathway analysis identified 1,256 organism-pathway pairs with nearly-complete metabolic pathways (score: `steps_missing_low`) where dark genes with strong fitness effects co-occur. **Note**: These are organism-level co-occurrences — each pair represents a species that has a nearly-complete pathway AND harbors dark genes, but no direct gene-to-gap enzymatic matching was performed. The co-occurrence suggests dark genes could encode missing steps, but confirming this requires EC number matching, structure prediction, or experimental validation. The most frequently gapped pathways are carbon source utilization pathways:

| Pathway | Category | Organisms with gaps | Example organisms |
|---------|----------|--------------------:|-------------------|
| Fucose utilization | carbon | 32 | Marinobacter, *P. stutzeri* RCH2, *D. vulgaris* |
| Rhamnose utilization | carbon | 31 | Marinobacter, *P. putida*, Phaeo |
| Sorbitol utilization | carbon | 30 | *D. desulfuricans*, *D. vulgaris*, Miyama |
| Myoinositol utilization | carbon | 28 | *P. putida*, *P. syringae*, WCS417 |
| Gluconate utilization | carbon | 26 | Marinobacter, *D. desulfuricans* |
| Asparagine biosynthesis | amino acid | 24 | across diverse phyla |

The organisms with the most gapped pathways — Marinobacter (49), *D. desulfuricans* ME-23 (45), *P. stutzeri* (45) — are also those with the largest dark gene complements and most specific fitness phenotypes, suggesting that their "missing steps" may be encoded by functionally dark genes.

### Finding 4: Cross-organism fitness concordance identifies 65 ortholog groups with conserved dark gene phenotypes

Of dark gene ortholog groups present in 3+ FB organisms, 65 show measurable fitness concordance — meaning orthologs of the same unknown gene produce fitness effects under the same condition classes across different bacterial species. The top concordant groups span carbon utilization, stress response, and motility:

| Ortholog group | Condition | Organisms | Concordance | Domains | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|----------:|------------:|---------|-------|
| OG11386 | carbon source | 8 | 1.00 | DUF5064 | In *P. putida*, *P. syringae*, *P. stutzeri* RCH2 |
| OG15006 | carbon source | 7 | 1.00 | — | In *Ralstonia* spp. |
| OG05812 | stress | 8 | 1.00 | Peptidase_M50 | In MR-1, SB2B; module-predicted TIGR01730 |
| OG05815 | stress | 8 | 1.00 | ParE_toxin | In *S. meliloti* |
| OG14628 | carbon source | 5 | 1.00 | — | In *Ralstonia* spp., strong concordance |
| OG12530 | carbon source | 4 | 1.00 | DUF2844 | In *B. thailandensis*, *Burkholderia* sp. 376 |
| OG03384 | stress | 6 | 1.00 | Metallophos | Module-predicted glutathione S-transferase |
| OG10428 | motility | 3 | 1.00 | ThiS | In *S. meliloti*; max |fit| = 2.2 |
| OG10455 | motility | 3 | 1.00 | MS_channel | In *S. meliloti*; mechanosensitive channel domains |

The strongest concordance is in carbon source genes (spanning 3–8 organisms) and motility genes (3 organisms each), suggesting conserved but unannotated components of carbohydrate metabolism and chemotaxis machinery respectively. The stress-concordant OG05812 carries a Peptidase_M50 domain (site-2 protease family), hinting at a conserved regulatory protease under stress.

### Finding 5: Dark gene families span diverse taxonomic breadth — 30,756 clusters mapped across 27,690 species

Phylogenetic breadth analysis of dark gene clusters reveals a range of conservation patterns: some are clade-restricted (single phylum) while others are widespread (3+ phyla). Widespread dark gene families represent the highest-priority unknowns — conserved across diverse bacteria yet still lacking functional annotation.

**Note**: The breadth classification derived from eggNOG OG hierarchies is coarse-grained: 99.9% of dark gene clusters (30,721 of 30,756) map to "universal" breadth (root-level eggNOG OGs present across domains of life), meaning the classification does not discriminate among candidates. The species-count metric (number of pangenome species sharing the same root OG) provides finer resolution, ranging from 1 to 33 species per OG (median=1, mean=2.2).

*(Notebook: 02_gapmind_concordance_phylo.ipynb)*

### Finding 6: Within-species biogeographic analysis reveals 10 dark gene clusters with significant environmental enrichment

Among 151 accessory dark gene clusters testable via carrier vs. non-carrier genome comparisons across 31 species, 10 showed significant environmental category enrichment (FDR < 0.05) and 1 showed significant AlphaEarth embedding divergence. The 10 significant clusters are:

| Organism | Locus | Condition | |fit| | Carrier env | Odds ratio | FDR | Breadth | Module prediction |
|----------|-------|-----------|------:|-------------|----------:|----:|---------|-------------------|
| *P. putida* | PP_0025 | stress | 4.8 | human_clinical | 27.5 | 7e-6 | — | PF13193 |
| *P. putida* | PP_3434 | nitrogen | 3.1 | human_clinical | 28.6 | 7e-6 | — | — |
| *P. putida* | PP_0642 | nitrogen | 2.8 | human_clinical | 11.6 | 0.001 | universal | — |
| *P. putida* | PP_3105 | stress | 3.7 | human_assoc | inf | 0.004 | — | — |
| *B. thetaiotaomicron* | 354052 | stress | 2.4 | human_assoc | 0.17 | 0.005 | universal | — |
| *P. syringae* B728a | Psyr_0167 | in planta | 4.6 | plant_assoc | 11.9 | 0.005 | universal | — |
| *B. thetaiotaomicron* | 350920 | stress | 2.2 | human_assoc | 0.37 | 0.031 | universal | — |
| *P. putida* N2C3 | AO356_11255 | nitrogen | 3.4 | freshwater | inf | 0.031 | universal | D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase |
| *K. oxytoca* | BWI76_RS15640 | carbon | 2.1 | human_assoc | 0.14 | 0.031 | universal | Phage tail tape-measure |
| *P. syringae* B728a | Psyr_2830 | stress | 3.4 | plant_assoc | 10.9 | 0.031 | universal | — |

Two patterns emerge: (1) *P. putida* dark genes with stress/nitrogen phenotypes are enriched in clinical isolates (human_clinical or human_associated), suggesting roles in host-associated niche adaptation; (2) *P. syringae* dark genes with in-planta or stress phenotypes are enriched in plant-associated genomes, consistent with their lab phenotypes. The *P. putida* N2C3 gene AO356_11255 — the project's top-ranked candidate — shows carriers exclusively in freshwater/soil environments, matching its nitrogen utilization lab phenotype.

### Finding 7: Lab-field concordance rate of 61.7%, with NMDC validation confirming 4/4 pre-registered abiotic predictions

Pre-registered mapping of FB experiment condition classes to expected environmental categories showed 29/47 (61.7%) of testable dark gene clusters are concordant: genomes carrying the gene are enriched in the environments predicted by their lab fitness phenotype. The strongest concordance is in pH-related genes (100%, n=4) and nitrogen source genes (78%, n=9). Six clusters reached FDR < 0.2 significance:

| Organism | Locus | Condition | |fit| | Expected environments | Carrier % | Non-carrier % | OR | FDR |
|----------|-------|-----------|------:|----------------------|----------:|--------------:|---:|----:|
| *K. oxytoca* | BWI76_RS15525 | carbon | 2.3 | soil, freshwater, plant | 14.3% | 2.5% | 6.6 | 0.069 |
| *K. oxytoca* | BWI76_RS15535 | carbon | 2.2 | soil, freshwater, plant | 14.3% | 2.5% | 6.6 | 0.069 |
| *P. putida* N2C3 | AO356_12450 | carbon | 2.1 | soil, freshwater, plant | 62.5% | 0% | inf | 0.093 |
| *P. putida* N2C3 | AO356_11255 | nitrogen | 3.4 | soil, freshwater, wastewater | 80.0% | 8.3% | 44.0 | 0.093 |
| *P. putida* N2C3 | AO356_25185 | anaerobic | 2.7 | soil, freshwater, animal | 55.6% | 0% | inf | 0.178 |
| *P. putida* N2C3 | AO356_24150 | nitrogen | 3.0 | soil, freshwater, wastewater | 55.6% | 0% | inf | 0.178 |

The *P. putida* N2C3 dark gene AO356_11255 (the project's top candidate) shows the clearest signal: 80% of carrier genomes come from soil/freshwater/wastewater environments vs. only 8.3% of non-carriers (OR = 44, FDR = 0.093), matching its lab phenotype of strong nitrogen utilization fitness.

![Lab-field concordance matrix](figures/fig11_concordance_matrix.png)

**NMDC independent validation** further corroborates the lab-field link. Using a two-tier taxonomy bridge (gtdb_metadata ncbi_taxid + taxonomy_dim fallback), 5 of 6 carrier genera were mapped to 47 NMDC taxon columns across 6,365 metagenomic samples. All 4 testable pre-registered predictions were confirmed:

| Condition class | Abiotic variable | rho | n | FDR | Direction |
|-----------------|-----------------|----:|--:|----:|-----------|
| nitrogen source | total nitrogen content | +0.109 | 1,231 | 2.3e-4 | Positive (expected) |
| nitrogen source | ammonium nitrogen | +0.231 | 1,230 | 8.0e-16 | Positive (expected) |
| pH | pH | +0.157 | 4,366 | 7.4e-25 | Positive (expected) |
| anaerobic | dissolved oxygen | -0.298 | 272 | 1.5e-6 | Negative (expected) |

Taxa carrying dark genes with nitrogen-source lab phenotypes are more abundant in NMDC samples with higher nitrogen availability; pH-phenotype carriers track with sample pH; and anaerobic-phenotype carriers are enriched in low-oxygen samples. These are independent confirmations — NMDC metagenomic samples are entirely separate from the pangenome-based carrier analysis.

Beyond these pre-registered predictions, 76 of 105 total Spearman correlation tests reached FDR < 0.05 (72.4%). However, this high rate likely reflects confounding: the carrier genera (*Pseudomonas*, *Klebsiella*, *Bacteroides*) are among the most abundant and ubiquitous taxa in NMDC samples, so their abundance correlates broadly with many abiotic variables regardless of condition class. The 4/4 pre-registered prediction rate is the more meaningful metric because it tests specific directional hypotheses.

**Note on condition-environment mapping**: The research plan specified 7 condition-environment mappings (including osmotic, temperature, and oxidative stress). The implementation used 6 mappings: stress (consolidating metal, osmotic, and oxidative), carbon source, nitrogen source, pH, motility, and anaerobic. The consolidation was necessary because the FB `expGroup` field uses broad "stress" rather than sub-categorizing stress types. Motility and anaerobic were added as they emerged as prominent condition classes among dark genes with strong fitness effects.

![NMDC correlation results](figures/fig12_nmdc_correlations.png)

**NMDC trait-condition validation** (NB06 Section 3) provides an additional layer: using the same genus bridge, carrier genera abundance was correlated with matching community functional trait scores from NMDC `trait_features` (76 functional_group columns across 6,365 samples). All 7 pre-registered predictions were confirmed (FDR < 10⁻²¹): nitrogen-source carriers correlate with nitrogen_fixation (ρ=0.60) and nitrate_denitrification (ρ=0.52); carbon-source carriers correlate with aerobic_chemoheterotrophy (ρ=0.73) and fermentation (ρ=0.59); anaerobic carriers correlate with fermentation (ρ=0.59) and iron_respiration (ρ=0.45). An additional 441/449 exploratory tests reached FDR < 0.05. However, these correlations likely reflect compositional coupling — genera abundant in a sample contribute to both carrier abundance and community trait scores — rather than independent gene-phenotype validation.

### Finding 8: Top 100 prioritized candidates span 23 organisms with 86% high-confidence functional hypotheses

Multi-dimensional scoring across 6 evidence axes (fitness importance, cross-organism conservation, functional inference quality, pangenome distribution, biogeographic signal, experimental tractability) ranked 17,344 dark genes. The top 100 candidates (score range: 0.556–0.650) come from 23 organisms, with Shewanella MR-1 (25 candidates), *P. putida* N2C3 (18), and Marinobacter (9) most represented. 86% of top candidates have high-confidence functional hypotheses supported by 3+ evidence types, and 89/100 have module-based function predictions.

The top 20 candidates with their evidence profiles:

| Rank | Organism | Locus | |fit| | Condition | Module prediction | Domains | Core? | Score |
|-----:|----------|-------|------:|-----------|-------------------|---------|:-----:|------:|
| 1 | *P. putida* N2C3 | AO356_11255 | 3.4 | nitrogen | D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase | EamA | acc | 0.650 |
| 2 | Shewanella MR-1 | 202463 | 6.4 | stress | PF01145 | YGGT | core | 0.633 |

| 16 | *P. putida* N2C3 | AO356_17245 | 3.6 | stress | K00763 | Biotin_lipoyl, HlyD | core | 0.606 |
| 17 | *P. putida* N2C3 | AO356_08210 | 4.0 | stress | K03808 | DUF3426, zinc_ribbon | core | 0.605 |
| 18 | *P. putida* | PP_0765 | 4.1 | carbon | PF00196 | DUF1302 | acc | 0.603 |

| 20 | Shewanella MR-1 | 203026 | 3.5 | carbon | — | AFG1_ATPase | core | 0.602 |

Several patterns emerge in the top candidates: (1) MR-1 genes 199738, 203545, and 202450 all carry K03306 module predictions with different domain architectures, suggesting paralogous members of a conserved nitrogen-responsive system; (2) MR-1 genes 202463 and 203247 both predict PF01145 under stress, pointing to a stress-responsive membrane protein family (YGGT/GBBH-like); (3) the top candidate AO356_11255 is the only accessory gene in the top 10, with the strongest biogeographic signal (lab-field OR = 44, NMDC nitrogen correlation).

### Finding 9: Experimental roadmap — 10 RB-TnSeq experiments cover 45% of the top 500 dark genes

Given that RB-TnSeq libraries already exist for the Fitness Browser organisms, which organism x condition experiments would have the highest return on investment for characterizing dark genes? We ranked all organism-condition pairs by the number of top-500 dark gene candidates they would address, then applied a greedy set-cover optimization:

| Priority | Organism | Condition | Dark genes addressed | Cumulative | % of Top 500 |
|---------:|----------|-----------|---------------------:|-----------:|-------------:|
| 1 | **Shewanella MR-1** | stress | 57 | 57 | 10.7% |
| 2 | **Shewanella MR-1** | nitrogen source | 31 | 88 | 16.5% |
| 3 | **Shewanella MR-1** | carbon source | 23 | 111 | 20.8% |
| 4 | ***P. putida* N2C3** | stress | 23 | 134 | 25.1% |
| 5 | ***S. meliloti*** | carbon source | 22 | 156 | 29.2% |
| 6 | ***S. meliloti*** | stress | 20 | 176 | 33.0% |
| 7 | ***P. stutzeri* RCH2** | stress | 20 | 196 | 36.7% |
| 8 | **Marinobacter** | stress | 18 | 214 | 40.1% |
| 9 | ***P. fluorescens* GW456-L13** | carbon source | 15 | 229 | 42.9% |
| 10 | ***P. putida*** | carbon source | 13 | 242 | 45.3% |

**Just 3 experiments in MR-1** (stress, nitrogen, carbon) would cover 111 top-500 candidates (20.8%), making MR-1 the single highest-value organism for dark gene characterization. This reflects MR-1's combination of deep condition coverage (121 conditions historically), a large dark gene complement (587 scored), and high fitness effect magnitudes (142 genes with |fit| ≥ 4).

The top MR-1 targets by condition include:

- **Stress (57 genes)**: led by 202463 (YGGT domain, |fit|=6.4), 203247 (GBBH-like_N, |fit|=4.6), and 203631 (|fit|=4.5) — all three carry PF01145 module predictions, suggesting a stress-responsive membrane protein family
- **Nitrogen (31 genes)**: led by the K03306 paralog trio 199738 (Gcw_chp/TIGR02001, |fit|=5.5), 203545 (DUF4124, |fit|=4.0), and 202450 (Gly_transporter, |fit|=3.9) — comparing single vs. double mutants would test functional redundancy
- **Carbon (23 genes)**: led by 202474 (YggL_50S_bp, |fit|=7.1) and 202608 (BcrAD_BadFG, |fit|=7.3) — the highest fitness magnitudes in the entire top-100

The second-highest-value organism is *P. putida* N2C3 (48 genes in top 500), where stress conditions alone would resolve 23 candidates. The #1-ranked gene AO356_11255 (D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase prediction, EamA domain, |fit|=3.4 under nitrogen) also has the strongest biogeographic signal (lab-field OR = 44, NMDC nitrogen correlation).

**Cross-organism ortholog coverage** amplifies the return: 101 ortholog groups in the top 500 span 2+ organisms. The most widely shared include:

| Ortholog group | Condition | Organisms | Significance |
|----------------|-----------|----------:|--------------|
| OG03827 | carbon source | 6 | MR-1, Marinobacter, ANA3, PV4, *P. fluorescens* N1B4, *P. simiae* N2E2 |
| OG02907 | nitrogen source | 6 | MR-1, *E. coli* Keio, *K. oxytoca*, *P. putida*, *P. fluorescens* N1B4, *P. simiae* N2E3 |
| OG01383 | pH | 5 | MR-1, *S. meliloti*, *C. metallidurans*, *P. fluorescens* GW456-L13, *P. putida* N2C3 |
| OG03534 | stress | 5 | MR-1, ANA3, *Dinoroseobacter*, PV4, *Synechococcus* |
| OG01997 | stress | 4 | MR-1, ANA3, *S. meliloti*, *P. putida* N2C3 |

Running stress experiments in MR-1 and *P. putida* N2C3 alone would provide cross-organism concordance data for OG01997 (stress) and, combined with nitrogen experiments, would test OG02907 and OG01383 across multiple genetic backgrounds. This is the most efficient path to identifying conserved dark gene functions.

### Finding 10: Phylogenetic gaps — which new organisms would most expand dark gene coverage?

The current Fitness Browser collection is heavily skewed toward Gammaproteobacteria (21/48 organisms, 78% of top-500 dark genes). Several major bacterial phyla are absent or severely underrepresented:

| Phylum/Class | Current FB coverage | Top-500 genes | Gap severity |
|-------------|--------------------:|--------------:|:------------:|
| Gammaproteobacteria | 21 organisms | 417 | Saturated |
| Betaproteobacteria | 8 organisms | 10 | Moderate |
| Alphaproteobacteria | 5 organisms | 71 | Low |
| Deltaproteobacteria | 5 organisms | 17 | Low |
| Bacteroidetes | 5 organisms | 12 | Low |
| **Firmicutes** | **1 organism** | **5** | **Critical** |
| Cyanobacteria | 1 organism | 2 | Moderate |
| Archaea | 2 organisms | 0 | Severe |
| **Actinobacteria** | **0** | **—** | **Critical** |
| **Epsilonproteobacteria** | **0** | **—** | **High** |

The most common domain families in the most widespread top-500 dark gene clusters (present in 15+ pangenome species) include TauE (sulfonate export, 7 clusters), DUF444 (5 clusters), Cu-oxidase_4 (5 clusters), EamA (4 clusters, including the #1 candidate), and DUF484/DUF971/DUF934 (3+ clusters each). These families span phyla not in the FB — adding organisms from missing phyla would enable cross-phylum concordance testing for these widespread unknowns.

**Recommended new organisms for RB-TnSeq library construction**, prioritized by (a) phylogenetic gap filled, (b) laboratory tractability, (c) overlap with widespread dark gene families, and (d) environmental/biomedical relevance:

| Priority | Organism | Phylum | Rationale |
|---------:|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | ***Bacillus subtilis* 168** | Firmicutes | The best-studied Gram-positive model organism. Well-established RB-TnSeq protocols exist (Koo et al. 2017). Would fill the largest phylogenetic gap and enable Gram-positive vs. Gram-negative comparisons for universal dark gene families (DUF484, DUF971, EamA). The existing FB strain BFirm produced only 5 top-500 genes — a purpose-built library with broader condition screening could greatly expand this. |
| 2 | ***Streptomyces coelicolor* A3(2)** | Actinobacteria | The premier Actinobacteria model, with complex secondary metabolism and development. Would add an entirely missing phylum. Genetically tractable with extensive tools. Its large genome (8.7 Mb, ~30% hypothetical) harbors many biosynthetic gene clusters where dark genes may encode novel enzymatic activities. |
| 3 | ***Clostridium difficile* 630** | Firmicutes (Clostridia) | Anaerobic Firmicute with major biomedical relevance. Would enable testing of anaerobic-phenotype dark genes (which showed strong NMDC dissolved oxygen correlation) in a strict anaerobe. Genetic tools and TnSeq have been established (Dembek et al. 2015). |
| 4 | ***Mycobacterium smegmatis* mc²155** | Actinobacteria | Fast-growing non-pathogenic mycobacterium, widely used as a model for *M. tuberculosis*. Tn-seq is well-established. Would provide the highest-impact Actinobacteria representative with direct translational relevance. |
| 5 | ***Campylobacter jejuni* NCTC 11168** | Epsilonproteobacteria | Would add the missing Epsilonproteobacteria. TnSeq has been applied successfully (de Vries et al. 2017). Important foodborne pathogen with unusual metabolic requirements. |
| 6 | ***Lactobacillus plantarum* WCFS1** | Firmicutes (Bacilli) | Plant-associated and gut-associated Firmicute with well-developed genetic tools. Would complement *B. subtilis* with a different ecological niche and enable testing carbon-source dark genes in a fermentative bacterium. |
| 7 | ***Rhodobacter sphaeroides* 2.4.1** | Alphaproteobacteria | Photosynthetic alphaproteobacterium with diverse metabolism (phototrophy, aerobic/anaerobic respiration, nitrogen fixation). Would strengthen cross-organism concordance testing for the 71 top-500 Alphaproteobacteria genes with an organism from a different metabolic strategy than *S. meliloti*. |

The first two additions (*B. subtilis* and *S. coelicolor*) would fill the two largest phylogenetic gaps (Firmicutes depth and Actinobacteria absence) and together would enable cross-phylum testing of the ~100 "universal" dark gene families that currently can only be studied in Proteobacteria.

### Finding 11: 9,557 essential dark genes ranked by gene neighbor context and cross-organism conservation — top 50 candidates with CRISPRi experiment designs

Essential dark genes (no viable transposon mutants) represent 55% of the experimentally actionable dark matter but score poorly in the fitness-centric NB05 framework. A separate prioritization using 5 evidence dimensions that do not require fitness magnitudes — gene neighbor context (0.25), cross-organism conservation (0.20), phylogenetic breadth (0.20), domain annotations (0.15), and CRISPRi tractability (0.20) — ranked all 9,557 essential dark genes.

Gene neighbor analysis provides the primary functional inference for essential genes lacking fitness profiles. Of 57,011 dark genes, 30,190 (52.9%) share a predicted operon with an annotated gene (same strand, gap < 300 bp), enabling guilt-by-association functional hypotheses. While 97.2% of dark genes have at least one annotated neighbor within a 5-gene window, this rate is expected for any gene given the 75% genome-wide annotation rate (P(≥1 annotated in 10 neighbors) > 99% by chance). More informatively, the mean annotated neighbor fraction (63.6%) is *below* the genome-wide 75% baseline, indicating that dark genes co-localize with other dark genes more than expected by chance — consistent with unannotated operonic clusters. Functional hypotheses from genomic proximity should be treated as leads for experimental testing, not validated assignments; published operon predictors (DOOR, ProOpDB) incorporate additional signals beyond strand and gap distance.

The top 10 essential dark gene candidates:

| Rank | Organism | Locus | Score | Domains | Operon context | Hypothesis confidence |
|-----:|----------|-------|------:|---------|----------------|:---------------------:|
| 1 | *E. coli* Keio | 14796 | 0.875 | YbeY, TIGR00043 | ion transport + NTP hydrolase | high |
| 2 | Shewanella MR-1 | 200382 | 0.874 | RimP_N, DUF150_C | tRNA-Met + NusA | high |
| 3 | *K. oxytoca* | BWI76_RS08540 | 0.865 | OmpA, TIGR02802 | TolB + CpoB (cell division) | high |
| 4 | *P. putida* N2C3 | AO356_29395 | 0.838 | Peptidase_M20 | ABC transporter + peptidase | high |
| 5 | Shewanella MR-1 | 201473 | 0.835 | EarP, TIGR03837 | EF-P + flavodoxin | high |
| 6 | *E. coli* Keio | 14768 | 0.833 | DUF493 | lipoate biosynthesis + PBP5 | high |
| 7 | Shewanella MR-1 | 200359 | 0.833 | YbeY, TIGR00043 | CorC + PhoH | high |
| 8 | *P. putida* | PP_1910 | 0.828 | YceD | 50S ribosomal L32 + PlsX | high |
| 9 | *P. putida* | PP_5002 | 0.828 | GBBH-like_N | HslVU protease + PhaC1 | high |
| 10 | *E. coli* Keio | 11474 | 0.825 | DUF4109 | tRNA-Met + translation | high |

All top-50 candidates have high-confidence functional hypotheses derived from operon context. Each includes a specific CRISPRi experiment design: target organism, sgRNA target, growth condition, expected phenotype, and validation strategy. For example, the #1 candidate (Keio:14796, YbeY domain) is predicted to function in ion transport based on its operon with an annotated ion transport gene, and can be tested by CRISPRi knockdown in *E. coli* Keio grown on varied carbon/nitrogen sources monitoring OD600 for growth defects.

## Interpretation

### Hypothesis Assessment

**H1 is partially supported; H0 can be partially rejected.** Dark genes with strong fitness effects are not randomly distributed — they show non-random patterns across multiple evidence dimensions. Critically, a matched comparison of dark vs. annotated gene cross-organism concordance (NB06) shows no significant difference (Mann-Whitney p=0.17, KS p=1.0): dark genes with orthologs in 3+ organisms achieve concordance levels indistinguishable from annotated genes (dark median=1.0, annotated median=1.0; dark mean=0.976, annotated mean=0.985). This supports H1 — dark genes behave like real functional genes, not noise. The specific sub-hypothesis assessments:

- **H1a (Functional coherence)**: Supported. 6,142 dark genes co-regulate with annotated genes in ICA modules, and 89/100 top candidates have module-based function predictions. The guilt-by-association approach from the `fitness_modules` project provides the single strongest inference layer.

- **H1b (Conservation signal)**: **Not supported.** Formal testing (Fisher's exact, n=7,491 dark genes; NB06) showed the opposite of the predicted pattern: stress-condition dark genes are 23.0% accessory, while carbon/nitrogen dark genes are 25.5% accessory (OR=1.15, p=0.013). The hypothesis that stress genes should be more accessory than carbon/nitrogen genes is rejected. This suggests that the relationship between condition specificity and pangenome conservation is more complex than a simple stress=accessory, metabolism=core dichotomy.

- **H1c (Cross-organism concordance)**: Supported for the 65 testable ortholog groups. Motility-related dark genes show the strongest cross-organism concordance, consistent with conserved but incompletely annotated chemotaxis machinery.

- **H1d (Biogeographic pattern)**: Supported. 10/137 clusters show significant environmental enrichment, the overall concordance rate (61.7%) exceeds the 50% chance level, and NMDC independent validation confirmed all 4 testable pre-registered predictions (nitrogen~nitrogen, pH~pH, anaerobic~dissolved oxygen). The strongest within-species signals are in *Pseudomonas* and *P. syringae*, while the NMDC correlations provide community-level corroboration across 6,365 metagenomic samples. Additionally, NMDC trait-condition analysis (NB06 Section 3) confirmed all 7 pre-registered predictions linking dark gene carrier genera abundance to matching community functional traits (e.g., nitrogen-source carriers correlate with nitrogen_fixation trait scores, ρ=0.60; carbon-source carriers correlate with aerobic_chemoheterotrophy, ρ=0.73). However, these high correlations likely reflect compositional coupling (shared genera drive both scores) rather than independent validation.

- **H1e (Pathway integration)**: Suggestive but not directly tested at the gene-to-step level. GapMind identifies 1,256 organism-pathway pairs where dark genes co-occur with metabolic gaps, but no direct gene-to-gap enzymatic matching was performed. Confirming that specific dark genes fill specific missing steps requires EC number matching, AlphaFold structure prediction, or experimental validation.

### Literature Context

The 24.9% dark gene fraction aligns with published estimates of 25–40% hypothetical genes in typical bacterial genomes (Makarova et al. 2019, *Biochem Soc Trans*). The approach of using genome-wide fitness profiling for function prediction was pioneered by Deutschbauer et al. (2011) in Shewanella MR-1, who used 121 conditions to propose functions for 40 previously hypothetical genes. This project extends that approach to 48 organisms and 7,552 conditions, leveraging the comprehensive Fitness Browser resource (Price et al. 2018, *Nature*).

The finding that Shewanella MR-1 dominates the top candidates (25/100) is consistent with MR-1's position as a model organism with extensive condition coverage and a large hypothetical gene complement. Vaccaro et al. (2016, *Appl Environ Microbiol*) demonstrated that fitness profiling in *Pseudomonas stutzeri* RCH2 could identify novel metal resistance genes among hypotheticals — our finding of stress-responsive dark genes in *Pseudomonas* species corroborates this pattern.

The lab-field concordance approach (testing whether lab fitness conditions predict field environments of gene carriers) is, to our knowledge, novel in its systematic application across multiple organisms and condition classes.

### Novel Contribution

This project contributes:

1. **A unified dark gene catalog** (57,011 genes across 48 bacteria) integrating fitness, conservation, module, ortholog, and domain data from 4 prior observatory projects — previously fragmented across separate analyses.

2. **Multi-dimensional experimental prioritization** combining 6 scored evidence axes, producing 100 ranked candidates with specific functional hypotheses and suggested experiments — directly actionable for the Arkin Lab and collaborators.

3. **Systematic lab-field concordance testing** — a new analytical framework connecting lab fitness phenotypes to environmental biogeography via pangenome carrier analysis, finding 61.7% concordance across 47 testable clusters, independently validated by NMDC metagenomic correlations (4/4 pre-registered predictions confirmed).

4. **Cross-organism fitness concordance** for dark gene families, revealing 65 ortholog groups with conserved phenotypes that could not be identified by studying any single organism.

### Limitations

1. **Environmental metadata sparsity**: AlphaEarth embeddings cover only 28% of genomes (83K/293K), and NCBI isolation source metadata is inconsistent, limiting the power of biogeographic tests.

2. **NMDC genus-level resolution**: The NMDC validation operates at genus level (mapping NMDC taxon columns to pangenome genera via ncbi_taxid), which may miss species-specific dark gene signals. Additionally, only 5 of 6 carrier genera were matched, and the high significance rate (76/105) likely reflects the dominance of common genera (e.g., *Pseudomonas*, *Klebsiella*) in both datasets.

3. **Annotation bias**: Some "hypothetical" genes may have annotations in databases not checked (UniProt, InterPro, recent NCBI updates). The dark gene count (57,011) likely overestimates the true number of functionally uncharacterized genes.

4. **Module prediction confidence**: Module-based function predictions (6,691 from `fitness_modules`) are guilt-by-association inferences, not direct experimental validation. The "high confidence" label in prioritization reflects evidence convergence, not experimental proof.

5. **Condition coverage unevenness**: Not all 48 organisms were tested under the same conditions. Organisms with more conditions (e.g., MR-1 with 121) produce more specific phenotypes, biasing them toward higher prioritization scores.

6. **GapMind pathway scope**: GapMind covers amino acid biosynthesis and carbon utilization pathways but not all metabolic functions. Dark genes involved in signaling, regulation, or structural roles are not captured by this analysis. Furthermore, the GapMind analysis identifies organism-level co-occurrence of pathway gaps and dark genes, not direct gene-to-step enzymatic assignments.

7. **Essential gene scoring penalty**: Of the 17,344 scored dark genes, 9,557 (55%) are essential (no viable transposon mutants). None appear in the NB05 top 100 candidates because essential genes have zero rows in `genefitness` (no fitness scores beyond the essentiality call), so dimension 1 (fitness importance) scores them at the essentiality bonus floor, and dimension 6 (experimental tractability) penalizes them for being non-knockable. A separate essential dark gene prioritization using gene neighbor analysis, phylogenetic breadth, cross-organism conservation, domain annotations, and CRISPRi tractability is provided in NB07, producing 50 ranked essential candidates amenable to CRISPRi knockdown experiments.

8. **NMDC trait correlation caveats**: The NMDC trait_features analysis (NB06 Section 3) found all 7 pre-registered trait-condition predictions confirmed with strong significance (FDR < 10⁻²¹), plus 441/449 exploratory tests significant (FDR < 0.05). However, the extremely high significance likely reflects compositional coupling: genera abundant in a sample contribute to both the carrier abundance score and the community trait score. These correlations demonstrate ecological co-occurrence rather than causal gene-phenotype links. A permutation test shuffling sample labels would provide a proper null distribution.

9. **Dark-vs-annotated controls partial**: The concordance null control (NB06) shows dark genes achieve concordance levels indistinguishable from annotated genes, supporting H1. However, equivalent null controls were not run for the biogeographic and lab-field concordance analyses. A full null comparison using annotated accessory genes through the same biogeographic pipeline would strengthen the H0 rejection.

10. **Scoring weight sensitivity**: Both prioritization frameworks use arbitrary expert-assigned weights. Sensitivity analysis (NB05/NB07) shows that while overall rank correlations remain high across alternative weight configurations (ρ > 0.93), the top-ranked candidate lists are moderately sensitive to weight choices. For NB05 (fitness-active): conservation-dominant and drop-tractability configurations each retain only 32/50 original top candidates (64%). For NB07 (essential): dropping tractability retains only 18/50 (36%) and dropping neighbor context retains 24/50 (48%). Users should treat specific rankings as approximate and focus on candidates that appear in the top tier across multiple weight schemes rather than relying on exact rank order.

## Future Directions

1. **Experimental validation of top candidates** — the top 5 candidates (4 in MR-1, 1 in *P. putida* N2C3) are immediately testable via RB-TnSeq under their predicted condition classes. Specific targets: AO356_11255 (D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase prediction, EamA domain — test under nitrogen limitation); MR-1 202463 (YGGT domain — test under multiple stress conditions); MR-1 199738/203545/202450 (K03306 paralog family — test under nitrogen limitation and compare single/double mutants).

2. **Expand to additional organisms** — 4 FB organisms lacked pangenome links. As BERDL coverage expands, re-running the pipeline on new species could identify additional candidates.

3. **Protein structure prediction** — for the top 100 candidates, AlphaFold2 structure predictions could provide additional functional clues, particularly for DUF-containing proteins where domain-level annotation is insufficient.

4. **NMDC multi-omics integration** — the NMDC dataset includes proteomics (346K observations) and metabolomics (3.1M observations) that were not used here. Correlating dark gene carrier abundance with metabolite or protein profiles could provide more direct functional evidence than abiotic correlations alone.

5. **CRISPRi validation of essential dark genes** — the top 50 essential candidates (NB07) include specific CRISPRi experiment designs. The highest-priority targets are Keio:14796 (YbeY domain, score 0.875, predicted ion transport), MR-1:200382 (RimP_N/DUF150_C, score 0.874, predicted ribosome assembly), and Koxy:BWI76_RS08540 (OmpA/TIGR02802, score 0.865, predicted cell division). These complement the RB-TnSeq approach for non-essential genes.

6. **Community resource** — publish the prioritized candidate list as a community resource for bacterial functional genomics, enabling other labs to target specific organisms or condition classes matching their expertise.

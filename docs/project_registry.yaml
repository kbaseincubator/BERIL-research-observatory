  title: ADP1 Deletion Collection Phenotype Analysis
  status: complete
  research_question: What is the condition-dependent structure of gene essentiality in *Acinetobacter baylyi* ADP1, as revealed
    by the de Berardinis single-gene deletion collection grown on 8 carbon sources?
  key_findings:

  - Conditions are largely independent — 5 PCs capture 82% of variance
  - The phenotype landscape is a continuum, not discrete modules
  - Condition-specific genes reveal the metabolic architecture of ADP1

  title: ADP1 Triple Essentiality Concordance
  status: complete
  research_question: Among genes that TnSeq says are dispensable in *Acinetobacter baylyi* ADP1, does FBA correctly predict
    which ones have growth defects? Can direct mutant growth rate measurements serve as an independent axis to evaluate where
    computational (FBA) and genetic (TnSeq) methods agree or disagree?
  key_findings:

  - The Null Result Is Robust Across Growth Defect Thresholds

  title: Aromatic Catabolism Support Network in ADP1
  status: complete
  research_question: Why does aromatic catabolism in *Acinetobacter baylyi* ADP1 require Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase), iron
    acquisition, and PQQ biosynthesis when growth on other carbon sources does not?
  key_findings:
  - Aromatic catabolism requires a 51-gene support network spanning 4 metabolic subsystems
  - Complex I is the largest support subsystem — and invisible to FBA
  - Support subsystems are genomically independent but metabolically coupled
  - Co-fitness assigns 16 unknown genes to specific subsystems
